Siliconrockstar Adminsinglesession

Prevents each admin account from having more than one session going at
a time. Useful to prevent admin users from sharing credentials, which
destroys accountability. Original session is automatically logged out
and redirected to the admin login page when a new session is created 
with the same creds.
